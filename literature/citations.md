**Abstract (trimmed):**

An Omnimagnet is an electromagnetic device that enables remote magnetic manipulation of devices such as medical implants and microrobots. It is comprised of three orthogonal nested solenoids with a ferromagnetic core at the center. Electrical current within the solenoids leads to Joule heating, resulting in undesired temperature increase within the Omnimagnet. If the temperature exceeds the melting point of the wire insulation, device failure will occur. Thus, a study of heat transfer within an Omnimagnet is a necessity, particularly to maximize the performance of the device. For the first time, a transient heat transfer model, that incorporates all three heat transfer modes, is proposed and validated with experimental data for an Omnimagnet with maximum root mean square error equal to 8${\%}$ (4$^{\circ}$C). This transient model is not computationally expensive. It is relatively easy to…

**Abstract (trimmed):**

The mass table in the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the PC-PK1 density functional has been established for even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\le Z\le120$, extended from the previous work for even-even nuclei [Zhang $\it{et.~al.}$ (DRHBc Mass Table Collaboration), At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 144, 101488 (2022)]. The calculated binding energies, two-nucleon and one-neutron separation energies, root-mean-square (rms) radii of neutron, proton, matter, and charge distributions, quadrupole deformations, and neutron and proton Fermi surfaces are tabulated and compared with available experimental data. A total of 4829 even-$Z$ nuclei are predicted to be bound, with an rms deviation of 1.477 MeV from the 1244 mass data. Good agreement with the available experimental odd-even mass differences, $α$ decay energies, and charge radii is also achieved. The description ac…

## 3. Melting of crystalline solids

**Abstract (trimmed):**

It is suggested that at the melting temperature the thermal phonon vibration is in self-resonance with the lattice vibration of the surface atomic/molecular layer. This self resonance occurs at a well defined temperature and triggers the detachment of the atomic/molecular sheet or platelets from the surface of the crystal. Thermodynamic data of five substances is used to test this hypothesis. The calculated average phonon vibrational wavelengths are equal with or harmonics of the d-spacing of the atomic/molecular sheets. The proposed model is able to explain all of the features of melting.

## 4. Melting in large sodium clusters: An orbital-free molecular dynamics study

**Abstract (trimmed):**

The melting-like transition in sodium clusters Na_N, with N=55, 92, and 142 is studied by using constant-energy molecular dynamics simulations. An orbital-free version of the Car-Parrinello technique is used which scales linearly with system size allowing investigation of the thermal behaviour of large clusters. The ground state isomer of Na_142 (an uncomplete three-shell icosahedron) melts in two steps: the first one (at approx. 240 K) is characterized by the high mobility of the atoms located on the cluster surface; the second, homogeneous melting (at approx. 270 K), involves diffusive motion of all the atoms across the cluster. For the case of Na_92, the icosahedral structure has a larger number of surface vacancies, and melts in two well separated steps, surface melting at approx. 130 K and homogeneous melting at approx. 240 K. Na_55, a complete two-shell icosahedron, melts in a sing…

- **Published:** 2010-12-29T11:50:28Z

**Abstract (trimmed):**

We study the combined influence of amino acid composition and chain length on the thermal stability of protein structures. A new parameterization of the internal free energy is considered, as the sum of hydrophobic effect, hydrogen-bond and de-hydration energy terms. We divided a non-redundant selection of protein structures from the Protein Data Bank into three groups: i) rich in order-promoting residues (OPR proteins); ii) rich in disorder-promoting residues (DPR proteins); iii) belonging to a twilight zone (TZ proteins). We observe a partition of PDB in several groups with different internal free energies, amino acid compositions and protein lengths. Internal free energy of 96% of the proteins analyzed ranges from -2 to -6.5 kJ/mol/res. We found many DPR and OPR proteins with the same relative thermal stability. Only OPR proteins with internal energy between -4 and -6.5 kJ/mol/res are…

**Abstract (trimmed):**

The range of critical thermal fluctuations in classical bulk superconductors is extremely small and especially in low fields hardly experimentally inaccessible. With a new type of calorimeter we have been able to resolve a small lambda anomaly within a narrow temperature range around the Hc2 line. We show that the evolution of the anomaly as a function of magnetic field follows scaling laws expected in the presence of critical fluctuations. The lower onset of the fluctuation regime shows many characteristics of a continuous solid-to-liquid transition in the vortex matter. It can be driven into a first-order vortex melting transition by a small AC field which helps the vortex matter to reach equilibrium.

## 7. Melting holographic mesons by applying a magnetic field

**Abstract (trimmed):**

In the present letter we use holographic methods to show that a very intense magnetic field lowers the temperature at which the mesons melt and decreases the mass gap of the spectrum along with their masses. Consequently, there is a range of temperatures for which mesons can be melted by applying a magnetic field instead of increasing the temperature. We term this effect Magnetic Meson Melting (MMM), and we are able to observe it by constructing a configuration that makes it possible to apply gauge/gravity methods to study fundamental degrees of freedom in a quark-gluon plasma subject to a magnetic field as intense as that expected in high energy collisions. This is achieved by the confection of a ten-dimensional background that is dual to the magnetized plasma and nonetheless permits the embedding of D7-branes in it. For such a background to exist, a scalar field has to be present and h…

## 8. What does the giant thermal Hall effect observed in the high temperature superconductors imply?

**Abstract (trimmed):**

A giant negative thermal Hall signal is discovered recently in the pseudogap phase of the high temperature superconductors\cite{Taillefer}. The Wiedemann-Franz law relating the charge and thermal transport is found to be strongly violated as the thermal Hall signal increases monotonically with decreasing doping in the pseudogap phase when the Hall response of the system is seen to be strongly suppressed. In particular, the thermal Hall signal is the strongest in the parent compounds, which are antiferromagnetic insulators. People believe that such an observation may challenge our understanding of the parent compounds as a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice, since it is forbidden by a well known no-go "theorem" for quantum magnets with an edge-sharing lattice. Here we show that the observed thermal Hall signal can be naturally understood as the orbital mag…

**Abstract (trimmed):**

The following properties are in the present literature associated with the behavior of super-cooled glass-forming liquids: faster than exponential growth of the relaxation time, dynamical heterogeneities, growing point-to-set correlation length, crossover from mean field behavior to activated dynamics. In this paper we argue that these properties are also present in a much simpler situation, namely the melting of the bulk of an ordered phase beyond a first order phase transition point. This is a promising path towards a better theoretical, numerical and experimental understanding of the above phenomena and of the physics of super-cooled liquids. We discuss in detail the analogies and the differences between the glass and the bulk melting transitions.

## 10. A dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model and holographic quarkonium melting in a magnetic field

**Abstract (trimmed):**

We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from inverse magnetic to magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.

## 11. Glassy dynamics as a melting process (On melting dynamics and the glass transition, Part II)

**Abstract (trimmed):**

There are deep analogies between the melting dynamics in systems with a first order phase transition and the dynamics from equilibrium in super-cooled liquids. For a class of Ising spin models undergoing a first order transition - namely p-spin models on the so-called Nishimori line - it can be shown that the melting dynamics can be exactly mapped to the equilibrium dynamics. In this mapping the dynamical -or mode-coupling- glass transition corresponds to the spinodal point, while the Kauzmann transition corresponds to the first order phase transition itself. Both in mean field and finite dimensional models this mapping provides an exact realization of the random first order theory scenario for the glass transition. The corresponding glassy phenomenology can then be understood in the framework of a standard first order phase transition.

## 12. Melting of 'porous' vortex matter

**Abstract (trimmed):**

Bitter decoration and magneto-optical studies reveal that in heavy-ion irradiated superconductors, a 'porous' vortex matter is formed when vortices outnumber columnar defects (CDs). In this state ordered vortex crystallites are embedded in the 'pores' of a rigid matrix of vortices pinned on CDs. The crystallites melt through a first-order transition while the matrix remains solid. The melting temperature increases with density of CDs and eventually turns into a continuous transition. At high temperatures a sharp kink in the melting line is found, signaling an abrupt change from crystallite melting to melting of the rigid matrix.

- **Published:** 1994-03-18T19:50:43Z

**Abstract (trimmed):**

Monte Carlo simulations of 2D vortex lattice melting in a thin superconducting film (or alternatively an array of Josephson junctions) are performed in the London limit. Finite size scaling analyses are used to make a detailed test of the dislocation mediated melting theory of KTNHY. We find that the melting transition is weakly first order, with a jump in the shear modulus very close to that predicted by the KTNHY theory. No hexatic liquid phase is found.

**Abstract (trimmed):**

While it has been shown repeatedly that ocean conditions exhibit an important control on the behaviour of grounded tidewater glaciers, modelling studies have focused largely on the effects of basal and surface melting. Here, a finite-element model of stresses near the front of a tidewater glacier is used to investigate the effects of frontal melting on calving, independently of the calving criterion used. Applications of the stress model to idealized scenarios reveal that undercutting of the ice front due to frontal melting can drive calving at up to ten times the mean melt rate. Factors which cause increased frontal melt-driven calving include a strong thermal gradient in the ice, and a concentration of frontal melt at the base of the glacier. These properties are typical of both Arctic and Antarctic tidewater glaciers. The finding that frontal melt near the base is a strong driver of c…

**Abstract (trimmed):**

Among all the properties required for the design of the next generation of PCM (density, heat capacity, thermal expansion, latent energy, volume change upon melting, corrosion rate, etc.) the thermal transport properties are by far the least known, especially for molten salt mixtures and solid solutions. We present in this paper a theoretical framework for accurate predictions of thermal conductivity of multicomponent salt-based PCM, from 273.15 K up to above melting temperature. The solid phase is considered as a microstructure with its proper temperature dependent parameters: phase volume fraction, grain size distribution, porosity, etc. As case studies, five new potential PCMs for CSP applications are considered. Their thermal conductivity is estimated as a function of temperature, from room temperature to 200 K above their melting point. The predictive capability of the proposed fram…
