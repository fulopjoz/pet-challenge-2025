## Notable Gaps / Missing Papers

The literature search did NOT find classic papers:
- Yoshida et al. (2016) - Discovery (Science)
- Son et al. (2019) - FAST-PETase (Nature Catalysis)
- Tournier et al. (2020) - Carbios 10,000x variant (Nature)
- Cui et al. (2021) - ML-guided engineering (Nature Communications)

**Possible reasons:**
- Search terms not matching PubMed indexing
- Papers in journals with different indexing
- Need DOI-based searching instead of keyword

---

## Next Steps for Data Collection

1. **Search by DOI** for missing key papers
2. **Fetch FASTA sequences** for:
   - Fast-PETase
   - DuraPETase
   - Carbios LCC variant
3. **Extract mutation tables** from papers
4. **Build activity score database** (normalized to wild-type)
